# Thumos_task

In order to better focus outreach efforts in the future, we need to determine which characteristics show a higher probability of purchasing a membership and/or purchasing an event ticket.

The column Result has one of six outcomes for each person:
+ Purchased membership: The ideal outcome, bought an event ticket and a membership
+ Purchased event: A positive outcome but not ideal
+ Approved: They were approved to come to an event but did not purchase
+ Sent personal f/u: Conversation was started but ended
+ Out of sequence: Conversation was started but ended
+ 2021 Member: Someone who was a previous member of the organization
